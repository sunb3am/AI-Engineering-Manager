# AI Engineering Manager
An "AI Engineering Manager" that finds roadblocks, points of failure and areas which need more resources by analyzing GitHub PR data and DORA Metrics/Trends.

# What is this though?
A simple RAG that uses Ollama, llama3.1, Chroma, Langchain and DORA Metrics data from [MiddlewareHQ](https://github.com/middlewarehq/middleware) to answer questions an Engineering Manager would have about their team's operations, project status and efficiency.

The script currently has a few example questions on the basis of the data of 3 prominent Open Source DevOps Tools: Prometheus, Grafana and Kubernetes.
